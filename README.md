Place the neon-nights.vim file in ~/.vim/colors/
If there is no colors folder. Just create it. It will work fine. 

If you want syntax highlighting just like mine in python. Use [vim-python](https://github.com/vim-python/python-syntax). Its tested with vundle and vim-python.

All the colors in this theme use xterm-256color scheme. So there's that.
